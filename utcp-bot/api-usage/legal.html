                </ul>
                <p><strong>4. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
                <p>The Bot's developers shall not be held liable for any direct,
                    indirect, incidental, consequential, or special
                    damages arising from or in any way connected to the use of

                <h3 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p><strong>1. Data Collection</strong></p>
                <p>The Bot may collect and store limited user data necessary for
                    its functioning within the Student Hub Discord
                    server. This data may include Discord user IDs, server
                    activity logs, and messages related to the Bot's
                    commands. For full details on logging, see the 
                    <a href="../utcp-bot/api-usage/legal.html">API Usage Legal 
                    Section</a>.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Data Usage</strong></p>
                <p>The collected data will be used solely for the purpose of
                    enhancing the user experience within the Student Hub
                    Discord server. It will not be shared, sold, or distributed
                    to third parties.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Data Security</strong></p>
                <p>All data is securely sent to/from our logging endpoint using
                    SHA-512 hashing. However, no method of transmission or storage
                    is entirely secure, and the developers cannot guarantee the
                    absolute security of the data. All users will be notified
                    immediately via email if any security breaches occur.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Consent</strong></p>
                <p>By using the Bot, you consent to the collection and usage of
                    data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Data Deletion</strong></p>
                <p>Due to the reasoning behind the logging endpoint, data sent
                    to it have no way to be deleted manually. All data is automatically
                    deleted after 12 months of it being unused. All users are advised
                    to keep personal details out of any forms or commands unless required
                    because of this nature.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></p>
                <p>The developers reserve the right to update or modify the
                    Privacy Policy. Users will be informed about
                    significant changes via email, and continued use of the Bot 
                    will imply acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
