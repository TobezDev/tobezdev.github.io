                <h3>What do I do?</h3>
                <p>During my free time, I really enjoy doing two things: coding and making music. Sometimes, when I'm coding, I make useful stuff like the website you're on right now. Other times, I just experiment and try out different things. And when it comes to music, I like creating all sorts of melodies that express different feelings. Coding and music are like my two sides. With coding, I create things that work, like tools and websites that do useful stuff. It's a bit like putting together a puzzle – each piece of code has to fit just right to make everything run smoothly. On the other hand, making music lets me be more artistic. I use different sounds and rhythms to make tunes that tell stories without words. It's like painting a picture, but with sounds instead of colors. So, in simple words, I spend my free time switching between these two cool things – coding for practicality and music for feelings and creativity. And by doing these things, I can bring a mix of logic and emotion to projects, including the website you're exploring now. </p>
